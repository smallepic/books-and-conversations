				<p class="lead"><em>Books &amp; Conversations</em> was born out of a desire to combine my two great loves&mdash;thought-provoking books and engaging conversation.</p>
				<p>Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that&rsquo;s what you see at a toy store. And you must think you&rsquo;re in a toy store, because you&rsquo;re here shopping for an infant named Jeb. </p>
				<p>Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I&rsquo;m in a transitional period so I don&rsquo;t wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can&rsquo;t give you this case, it don&rsquo;t belong to me.</p>
				<p>Besides, I&rsquo;ve already been through too much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass. </p>
